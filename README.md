# SCMMI_Benchmark

---------------------------

### Description

SCMMI_benchmark is a benchmark pipeline for evaluating the usability, accuracy and robustness of single-cell multimodal integration algorithms, including 16 paired scRNA+scATAC integration methods, 13 unpaired scRNA+scATAC integration methods and 12 scRNA+ADT integration. This folder contains accuracy assessment scripts for benchmark analysis.


### Assessment scripts for SCMMI_Benchmark manuscript

The folder includes scripts to calculate single-embedding metrics and cross-embedding metrics for paired and unpaired multimodal integration.  <br>

- single-embedding metrics [code](scripts/assess/single_embedding_metrics_benchmark.py)
- cross-embedding metrics[code](scripts/assess/cross_embedding_metrics_benchmark.py)

### Datasets
The benchmark baseline datasets can be downloaded from [single-cell multimodal integration challenge competition](https://openproblems.bio/events/2021-09_neurips/).  <br>
